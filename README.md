##Skylands Rising

 
Multiplayer Enabled 3D Physics enabled XNA game using JibLibX and Lidgren networking.

A game based in the clouds, the prototype can handle 2 players.  
Most of the work involved incorporating a networking engine into a JigLibX Physics engine.

I created the Game Launcher using WPF and C#

I then imported some high poly models and had some fun.

The networking code will need further development to enable more than 2 players. 
Terrain / object creation works along with fully working collision detection. 

Due to the amount of time it has been taking up I am putting this on a back burner to finish my other higher priority projects first.

#The name
I actually came up with the name "Skylands" and started to publicly work on it, about a year before "Skylanders" was released.  Ironically I have decided to keep the name for now, but I could see myself getting sued if I were to release it as such!
