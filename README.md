Multiplayer Enabled 3D Physics ennabled XNA game.

A game based in the clouds, the prototype can handle 2 players.  
Most of the work involved incorporating a networking engine into a JigLibX Physics engine.
I then imported some high poly models and had some fun.  
The networking code will need further development to enable more than 2 players. 
Terrain / object creation works along with fully working collision detection. 

Due to the amount of time it has been taking up I am putting this on a back burner to finish my other higher priority projects first.
